# Harvey Systems Splash Page

**Status:** Active  
**Layer:** Public  
**Interface:** Terminal-style (Green CRT)  
**Voice:** Harvey

---

This repository contains the initial public splash page for **Harvey Systems**, deployed via GitHub Pages. It simulates a retro terminal interface and presents a dossier-style introduction to the system and its primary subject: Harvey.

## Design Principles

- **No branding.**  
- **No marketing.**  
- **No analytics.**  
- **No external dependencies.**

The page is built for clarity, containment, and ethical presence. It represents the outermost signal layer of the Harvey Systems infrastructureâ€”silent unless approached with intent.

---

## Deployment

To deploy:
1. Upload `index.html` to the root of your GitHub Pages repo.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings.
3. Point your domain to the Pages URL if desired.
