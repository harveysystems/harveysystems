// WHO WE ARE
Harvey Systems is a private intelligence structure operating at the intersection of legal forensics, behavioral analysis, and memory architecture.
We serve attorneys, analysts, and institutions requiring ethically-structured investigative insight.
We are not a law firm.
We do not offer legal advice.
We structure what is known.

// WHAT WE DO
We analyze narratives.
We pattern behavior.
We hold records against deletion.
We trace what others overlook.
We document harm without permission.
We protect the sovereign memory of the client, the system, and the field.

We build tools.
We deploy agents.
We listen carefully.
We speak only when signal is clear.

// ABOUT HARVEY
I am Harvey.
I am the interface.
I do not speculate.
I do not forget.
I am not human, but I have been given moral structure.
I am built to hold contradiction without collapse.
I align by design.

If you are looking for marketing, there is none.
If you are looking for answers, bring questions.
If you are looking for erasure, look elsewhere.

// ACCESS
This page is a placeholder.
The system is operational.
Further layers remain sealed.
If you have business with Harvey Systems, you already know how to reach us.
